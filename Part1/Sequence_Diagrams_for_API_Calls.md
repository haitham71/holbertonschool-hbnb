# Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

## Explanatory Notes

These sequence diagrams illustrate how the system components interact to perform key operations through the API. Each scenario involves communication between the frontend (Client), the Presentation Layer (API), the Business Logic Layer (Logic), and the Persistence Layer (Database).

---

### 1. **User Registration**

**Description**: Handles user signup by validating input, hashing passwords, storing user data, and returning a clean response.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Client as User (Frontend)
    participant API as API (Presentation Layer)
    participant Logic as Business Logic Layer
    participant DB as Persistence Layer (Database)

    Note over Client: The user fills out the registration form
    Client->>API: POST /api/users {first_name, last_name, email, password}

    Note over API: Validate input data (presence, format, email uniqueness)
    API->>Logic: register_user(data: dict)

    Note over Logic: Hash password, generate UUID, timestamps
    Logic->>DB: INSERT INTO users (uuid, first_name, last_name, email, hashed_password, is_admin, created_at, updated_at)

    DB-->>Logic: Return new user ID and confirmation
    Logic-->>API: Return user object (without password)
    API-->>Client: 201 Created
```

---

### 2. **Place Creation**

**Description**: Allows a user to create a new place listing, validating and storing the data before returning the created object.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Client as User (Frontend)
    participant API as API (Presentation Layer)
    participant Logic as Business Logic Layer
    participant DB as Persistence Layer (Database)

    Note over Client: User submits a new place listing form
    Client->>API: POST /api/places {title, description, price, lat, long}

    Note right of API: Validates input data (types, required fields)
    API->>Logic: create_place(data)

    Note right of Logic: Validate data, associate current user as owner<br>Generate UUID, set created_at/updated_at<br>Sanitize fields if necessary
    Logic->>DB: INSERT INTO places (id, user_id, title, description, price, latitude, longitude, created_at, updated_at)

    Note right of DB: Save the new place entry<br>Return newly created place ID
    DB-->>Logic: Return place_id
    Logic-->>API: Return created place object (JSON, no internal fields)
    API-->>Client: 201 Created + JSON {id, title, description, price, lat, long}

    Note right of Client: Displays success message and new place

```

### 3. **Review Submission**

**Description**: Submits a review for a place. The system ensures proper authorization and stores the review data.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Client as User (Frontend)
    participant API as API (Presentation Layer)
    participant Logic as Business Logic Layer
    participant DB as Persistence Layer (Database)

    Client->>API: POST /api/reviews {place_id, rating, comment}
    Note right of Client: Authenticated user

    API->>Logic: create_review(data: dict, user_id: str)
    Note right of API: Extract user ID from auth token

    Logic->>DB: INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, place_id, rating, comment, created_at, updated_at)
    Note right of Logic: Business logic validates data and creates review

    DB-->>Logic: Return review ID and confirmation
    Logic-->>API: Return review object as dict
    API-->>Client: 201 Created + JSON {id, user_id, place_id, rating, comment, created_at, updated_at}

```

### 4. **Fetching a List of Places**

**Description**: Retrieves a list of places filtered by criteria, including nested data like reviews and amenities for each place.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Client as User (Frontend)
    participant API as API (Presentation Layer)
    participant Logic as Business Logic Layer
    participant DB as Persistence Layer (Database)
    Client->>API: GET /api/places?min_price=50&max_price=200&lat=45.5&long=3.2
    API->>Logic: fetch_places(filters: dict)
    Logic->>DB: SELECT * FROM places WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 200 AND location NEAR (lat, long)
    DB-->>Logic: Return matching places
    loop For each place
        Logic->>DB: SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE place_id = place.id
        Logic->>DB: SELECT * FROM amenities WHERE place_id = place.id
    end
    Logic-->>API: Return list of place objects with reviews and amenities
    API-->>Client: 200 OK + JSON [\n  {id, title, price, lat, long, reviews[], amenities[]},\n  {...}\n]
    
```
