## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a **3-layer architecture**:

```
Presentation Layer (API)
         ↓
Business Logic Layer
         ↓
Persistence Layer (Database)
```

### Core Entities
- **User**: Manages user accounts
- **Place**: Property listings
- **Review**: User feedback on places
- **Amenity**: Property features (WiFi, pool, etc.)
